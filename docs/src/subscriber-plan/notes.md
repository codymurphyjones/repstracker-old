Subscriber Plan, which was previously based on option sets in bubble, in the new system is a two table system where global subscriber plans are available for any org to subscibe to (certain limitations may apply.)

A subscriber plan stores the details for how a subscription plan registers within the Stripe, Play, and App payment flows.

The new data table, OrgSubscriberPlan allows an org to reference a subscriber plan and attach itself to a plan shared across the system by many different orgs.
